ACT University, which is rapidly expanding its range of distance education due to COVID-19, and this university was running its work via the Internet using simple database developed by one of their students five years ago. Because of COVID-19, the system became very slow, and documents were not issued upon completion of the project that mean no documentation, for this reason the adjustment became difficult and also after 5 years the requirements of the university had changed for this reason they decided to invest in a new technology and a new system in order to successfully grow and manage their business. So, they required our company to develop a database system and provide the technology needed to operate the system.  This means that we will build an excellent database for the university and also build a highly efficient database linked program to manage all the data of this institution quite easily. Also, through this report, we will be able to understand all the steps taken to build the database. Also, this report will assist in developing this system in the future through documentation.
